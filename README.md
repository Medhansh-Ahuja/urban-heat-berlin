# Urban Heat Berlin
This project analyses the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect across Berlin’s 12 Bezirke using Python and GIS tools.

Completed so far:
- Created a Berlin Bezirke base map from OpenStreetMap using OSMnx and GeoPandas
- Cleaned geometries and dissolved them into 12 districts
- Exported the final district boundaries as GeoJSON and pushed to GitHub

Next steps:
- Integrate urban heat data (air temperature and/or land surface temperature)
- Aggregate heat metrics by Bezirk and create visualisations (e.g., choropleth maps)
